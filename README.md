# vue-calzyr
Calzyr is an easy-to-use calendar vue component.

```
Package is still WIP ⚙️
```

## How to use

you simply import the package into your vue file and you are ready to go.. but wait. 
i have a very empty calendar right now.. thats right! you can add the props as attributes to the tag
just like you add tags to your <b>HTML</b> for example:

```html
<VueCalzyr darkMode />
```
